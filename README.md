# AWS Cloud Resume Challenge

This my own aws cloud resume challenge attempt. In case you are unfamiliar with this challenge,
here is a link to the website: [aws-cloud-resume-challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/).

My initial goal was to use this challenge as a way of getting to know the different services aws provides and having some fun deploying my first own website,
but as I later found out, this would be a lot more difficult than just playing around with some buttons.
